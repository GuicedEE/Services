/**
 * This package contains the API for JCache. JCache describes the technique
 * whereby Java developers use a {@link jakarta.cache.spi.CachingProvider} to
 * temporarily cache Java objects. It provides a common way for Java programs
 * to create, access, update and remove entries from caches.
 * <strong>Core Concepts</strong>
 * The Java Caching API defines five core interfaces:
 * {@link jakarta.cache.spi.CachingProvider}, {@link jakarta.cache.CacheManager},
 * {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}, {@link jakarta.cache.Cache.Entry} and
 * {@link jakarta.cache.expiry.ExpiryPolicy}.
 * <p>
 * A {@link jakarta.cache.spi.CachingProvider} defines the mechanism to establish,
 * configure, acquire, manage and control zero or more
 * {@link jakarta.cache.CacheManager}s.  An application may access and use zero
 * or more {@link jakarta.cache.spi.CachingProvider}s at runtime.
 * <p>
 * A {@link jakarta.cache.CacheManager} defines the mechanism to establish,
 * configure, acquire, manage and control zero or more uniquely named
 * {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}s all within the context of the
 * {@link jakarta.cache.CacheManager}. A {@link jakarta.cache.CacheManager} is
 * owned by a single {@link jakarta.cache.spi.CachingProvider}.
 * <p>
 * A {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} is a Map-like data-structure that permits
 * the temporary storage of Key-based Values, some what like
 * {@link java.util.Map} data-structure.  A {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} is owned
 * by a single {@link jakarta.cache.CacheManager}.
 * <p>
 * An {@link jakarta.cache.Cache.Entry} is a single key-value pair stored by a
 * {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}.
 * <p>
 * Each entry stored by a {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} has a defined duration, called
 * the Expiry Duration, during which they may be accessed, updated and removed.
 * Once this duration has passed, the entry is said to be expired. Once expired,
 * entries are no longer available to be accessed, updated or removed, just as if
 * they never existed in a {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}. Expiry is set using an
 * {@link jakarta.cache.expiry.ExpiryPolicy}.
 * <strong>Store-By-Value and Store-By-Reference</strong>
 * Entries are stored by individual {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}s using one of two
 * mechanisms:
 * store-by-value and store-by-reference.
 * <h2>Store-By-Value</h2>
 * The default mechanism, called store-by-value, instructs an implementation to
 * make a copy of application provided keys and values prior to storing them in a
 * {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} and later to return a new copy of the entries when
 * accessed from a {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of copying entries as they are stored in a {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}
 * and again when they are returned from a {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} is to allow
 * applications to continue mutating the state of the keys and values without causing
 * side-effects to entries held by a {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}.
 * <h2>Store-By-Reference</h2>
 * The alternative and optional mechanism, called store-by-reference, instructs a
 * {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} implementation to simply store and return references to
 * the application provided keys and values, instead of making a copies as required by
 * the store-by-value approach.  Should an application later mutate the keys or values
 * provided to a {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} using store-by-reference semantics, the
 * side-effects of the mutations will be visible to those accessing the entries from
 * the {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}, without an application having to update the
 * {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}.
 * <strong>{@link jakarta.cache.Cache}s and {@link java.util.Map}s</strong>
 * While {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}s and {@link java.util.Map}s share somewhat similar
 * APIs, {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}s are not Maps and {@link java.util.Map}s are not
 * {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}s.
 * The following section outlines the main similarities and differences.
 * <p>
 * Like {@link java.util.Map}-based data-structures:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link jakarta.cache.Cache} values are stored and accessed through an associated
 * key.</li>
 * <li>Each key may only be associated with a single value in a
 * {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}. <li>Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are
 * used as keys. The behavior of a {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} is undefined if a key
 * is mutated in a manner that affects equals comparisons when a key is used with
 * a {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}.</li> <li>{@link jakarta.cache.Cache}s depend on the
 * concept of equality to determine when keys and values are the same. Consequently
 * custom key and value classes should define a suitable implementation of the
 * {@link java.lang.Object#equals} method.</li> <li> Custom key classes should
 * additionally provide a suitable implementation of the
 * {@link java.lang.Object#hashCode()} method.
 * <p>
 * Although recommended, implementations are not required to call either the
 * Object.hashCode or Object.equals methods defined by custom key classes.
 * Implementations are free to use optimizations whereby the invocation of these
 * methods is avoided.
 * <p>
 * As this specification does not define the concept of object equivalence it
 * should be noted applications that make use of custom key classes and rely on
 * implementation specific optimizations to determine equivalence may not be
 * portable.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Unlike {@link java.util.Map}-based data-structures:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link jakarta.cache.Cache} keys and values must not be null.</li>
 * <li>Any attempt to use null for keys or values will result in a
 * {@link java.lang.NullPointerException} being thrown, regardless of the use.</li>
 * <li>Entries may expire.</li>
 * <li>Entries may be evicted.</li>
 * <li>To support the compare-and-swap (CAS) operations, those that atomically
 * compare and exchange values, custom value classes should provide a suitable
 * implementation of {@link java.lang.Object#equals}.
 * <p>
 * Although recommended, implementations are not required to call the
 * {@link java.lang.Object#equals} method defined by custom value classes.
 * Implementations are free to implement optimizations whereby the invocation
 * of this method is avoided. </li>
 * <li>Implementations may require Keys and Values to be serializable in some
 * manner.</li>
 * <li>{@link jakarta.cache.Cache}s may be configured to control how entries are stored,
 * either using
 * store-by-value or optionally using store-by-reference semantics.</li>
 * <li> Implementations may optionally enforce security restrictions. In case of a
 * violation, a {@link java.lang.SecurityException} must be thrown.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <strong>Consistency</strong>
 * Consistency refers to the behavior of caches and the guarantees that exist when
 * concurrent cache mutation occur together with the visibility of the mutations
 * when multiple threads are accessing a cache.
 * <p>
 * All implementations must support the Default Consistency model as outlined
 * below.
 * <h2>Default Consistency</h2>
 * When using the default consistency mode, most {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} operations
 * are performed as if a locking mechanism exists for each key in a
 * {@link jakarta.cache.Cache}. When a cache operation acquires an exclusive read and
 * write lock on a key all subsequent operations on that key will block until that
 * lock is released. The consequences are that operations performed by a thread
 * happen-before read or mutation operations performed by another thread, including
 * threads in different Java Virtual Machines.
 * <p>
 * For some {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} operations the value returned by a
 * {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} is considered the last value. The last value might be an
 * old value or a new value, especially in the case where an entry is concurrently being
 * updated. It is implementation dependent which is returned.
 * <p>
 * Other operations follow a different convention in that mutations may only occur
 * when the current state of an entry matches a desired state. In such operations
 * multiple threads are free to compete to apply these changes i.e. as if they
 * share a lock.
 * <p>
 * As these methods must interact with other {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} operations
 * acting as if they had an exclusive lock, the CAS methods cannot write new values
 * without acting as if they also had an exclusive lock.
 * <p>
 * See the JCache Specification for further details.
 * <h2>Further Consistency Models</h2>
 * An implementation may provide support for different consistency models in
 * addition to the required <em>Default Consistency</em> mode
 * <strong>A Simple Example</strong>
 * <p>This simple example creates a default {@link jakarta.cache.CacheManager},
 * configures a {@link jakarta.cache.Cache} on it called â€œsimpleCache? with a key type
 * of String and a value type of Integer and an expiry of one hour and then performs
 * a some cache operations.
 * </p>
 * <pre><code>
 * //resolve a cache manager
 * CachingProvider cachingProvider = Caching.getCachingProvider();
 * CacheManager cacheManager = cachingProvider.getCacheManager();
 *
 * //configure the cache
 * MutableConfiguration&lt;String, Integer&gt; config =
 *    new MutableConfiguration&lt;&gt;()
 *    .setTypes(String.class, Integer.class)
 *    .setExpiryPolicyFactory(AccessedExpiryPolicy.factoryOf(ONE_HOUR))
 *    .setStatisticsEnabled(true);
 *
 * //create the cache
 * Cache&lt;String, Integer&gt; cache = cacheManager.createCache("simpleCache", config);
 *
 * //cache operations
 * String key = "key";
 * Integer value1 = 1;
 * cache.put("key", value1);
 * Integer value2 = cache.get(key);
 * cache.remove(key);
 * </code></pre>
